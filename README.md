Itero – Gamified Agile Project Management 🎮✨

🌟 What is Itero?

Itero turns project management into a game.
It’s a Trello Power-Up that adds a Motivation Dashboard where tasks become XP, streaks, and challenges. Instead of just ticking boxes, you and your team stay motivated, track your flow, and even log your daily mood.

Think of it as Agile with a spark of fun. 🚀
